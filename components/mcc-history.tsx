About 53 Ceylon Tamils assembled at the residence of Mr. V. Sinnappah, the well-known and influential Station-Master of Kuala Lumpur. The association was formed with two primary objectives: (1) To build and maintain a Kandasamy Temple and the Cremation Ground on Circular Road which had been granted to the Ceylon Tamils by the Selangor Government, and (2) To safeguard the general interests of the Ceylonese residing in Malaya. The first president was Mr. Visuvanathan, Head Overseer of the P.W.D. in Kuala Lumpur.",

Navaratnam, Secretary of the Selangor Ceylon Tamils Association, made a bold attempt to form a more inclusive association that would unite all Ceylonese communities - Tamils, Singhalese, Burghers, Moors, and Ceylon Malays. This initiative reflected the vision expressed by Sir Andrew Caldecott: 'If you are going to be good Ceylonese, you must have Tamils, Singhalese, Burghers, Moors and Malay Clubs all of them.' The association successfully became an active and useful institution serving the broader Ceylonese community.",

Members were encouraged to invest in the JCS, and loans at reasonable rates were granted for educational expenses, medical treatment, funeral expenses, and purchase of household necessities. Additionally, the Malayan Ceylonese Provident Fund was planned and organized by the Association, becoming tremendously popular among the community. Its phenomenal growth necessitated the Fund being conducted as a separate organization, with Mr. M. W. Navaratnam serving as its president for over 18 years.",

On December 9, 1955, the Chief Minister and newly-elected Ceylonese representatives were hosted at a tea party. Mr. Navaratnam expressed confidence in the Chief Minister's mission, saying there was 'no doubt his mission to Britain to obtain Merdeka will be a complete success.'

The formation came as a response to the lack of unity among the Ceylonese population. The MCC was created as an opposition to the Ceylon Federation of Malaya, which at that time was the only government-recognized Ceylonese party, enjoying the privilege of a seat in the Senate and representation in all official functions.",

The President emphasized that several unsuccessful attempts had been made in the past, but undaunted by these failures, representatives of the various Ceylonese communities had gathered to inaugurate the MCC.
